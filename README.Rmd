`bumbl` implements a model for bumblebee colony growth described in Crone and Williams 2016^1^. The `brkpt` function models colony growth as having a change point at some time, *tau*, where the colony switches from growth and worker production to gyne production.  The `bumbl` function applies this model to a data frame of data from multiple colonies, allowing for each colony to have it's own *tau* and returns the original data augmented with coefficients from the changepoint model.

This is still in very early development, so use at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install this development version of `bumbl` with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Aariq/bumbl", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Getting started

View the package vignette with:

``` r
library(bumbl)
vignette("bumbl")
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# library(bumbl)
devtools::load_all()
```

View the `bomubs` dataset

```{r}
head(bombus)
```

### Example use

Using a subset of the `bombus` dataframe to estimate the week (tau) that colonies switch to reproduction

```{r}
bombus2 <- bombus[bombus$colony %in% c(9, 82, 98, 35), ]
results <- bumbl(bombus2, colonyID = colony, t = week, formula = d.mass ~ week)
results
```

Plot the results

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(results)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```
