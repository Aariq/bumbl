`bumbl` implements a model for bumblebee colony growth described in Crone and Williams 2019^1^. The `brkpt` function models colony growth as having a change point at some time, *tau*, where the colony switches from growth and worker production to gyne production.  The `bumbl` function applies this model to a dataframe of data from multiple colonies, allowing for each colony to have it's own *tau* and returns the original data augmented with coefficients from the changepoint model.

This is still in very early development, so use at your own risk.

## Installation

You can install this development version of `bumbl` with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Aariq/bumbl")
