# bumbl 0.0.0.9001

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* This is the first minimally functioning version of bumbl.  More features to come.  Feedback welcome.
* Might not work on Windows currently due to dependency on `tidyr` 1.0.0, which apparently isn't available for the most recent version of R on windows.
