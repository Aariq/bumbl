\arguments{
\item{larv_surv}{Larval survival rate.}

\item{dev_time_mean}{Mean development time from egg to adult, in days.}

\item{wkr_size_min}{Minimum observed worker intertegular span (ITS), in mm.}

\item{wkr_size_max}{Maximum observed worker ITS, in mm.}

\item{wkr_size_mean}{Mean observed worker ITS, in mm.}

\item{wkr_size_sd}{Observed standard deviation of worker ITS.}

\item{poln_cost}{Grams of pollen needed to make a gram of new worker.  The
default was estimated as the mean mass of pollen per cell / mean worker
mass.}

\item{prop_foraging}{Proportion of workers allowed to forage.  When less than
1, the smallest \code{1 - prop_foraging} workers do not contribute resources to
recruitment of new larvae.}

\item{wkr_mass_f}{A function relating worker mass to worker ITS.}

\item{wkr_surv_f}{Worker survival as a function of worker ITS.}

\item{p_forage_f}{Probability of a worker making a foraging trip as a
function of ITS.}

\item{p_poln_ret_f}{Probability of a worker returning from a foraging trip
with pollen, as a function of ITS.}

\item{trips_f}{The average number of foraging trips per day as a function of
worker ITS.}

\item{poln_mass_f}{The mass of pollen returned per trip as a function of ITS,
in grams}

growth rate, lambda.

\description{
Builds an size- and age-based integral projection model to estimate bumblebee
colony growth using vital rates estimated from previously published empirical
work, as described in Kerr, et al. (\emph{in prep}).
}
\details{
Defaults for all functions are estimated from data and published in
Kerr et al. (\emph{in prep}). Parameters ending in \verb{_f} expect the name of a
function or an anonymous function.

\examples{
# Original model:
bipm()
# Effect of reducing larval survival:
bipm(larv_surv = 0.97)
