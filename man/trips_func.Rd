\title{Number of foraging trips per day as a function of bumblebee worker size}
\usage{
trips_func(wkr_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{wkr_size}{a vector of worker ITS values in mm}
}
\value{
a vector of mean number of trips per day
}
\description{
Estimates the number of foraging trips per day of a worker bumblebee as a
function of body size (intertegular span) as described in Kerr et al. 2019.
Specifically, trips = exp(-10.441800289970 + (5.690241104687 * wkr_size) +
(-0.689656110476 * wkr_size^2))
}
