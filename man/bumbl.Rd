\usage{
bumbl(
  data,
  t,
  formula,
  family = gaussian(link = "log"),
  colonyID = NULL,
  augment = FALSE,
  taus = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe or tibble with a column for colony ID (as a
\code{character} or \code{factor}), a column for some measure of time (\code{numeric}),
and a column for some measure of colony growth (\code{numeric}), at minimum.}

\item{t}{the unquoted column name of the time variable.}

\item{formula}{a formula with the form \code{response ~ time + covariates} where
response is your measure of colony growth, time is whatever measure of time
you have (date, number of weeks, etc.) and covariates are any optional
co-variates you want to fit at the colony level.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function.
This is passed to \code{glm()} except in the case of \code{family = "negbin"}, which
causes \code{glm.nb()} to be used to fit a negative binomial GLM.}

\item{colonyID}{the unquoted column name of the colony ID variable}

\item{augment}{when FALSE, \code{bumbl} returns a summary dataframe with one row
for each colonyID.  When TRUE, it returns the original data with additional
columns containing model coefficients.}

\item{taus}{an optional vector of taus to test. If not supplied, \code{seq(min(t), max(t), length.out = 50)} will be used.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{glm()} or \code{glm.nb()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the additional class \code{bumbldf} containing a
summary of the data with a row for every colony and the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{tau} is the switchpoint, in the same units as \code{t}, for
each \code{colonyID}.  The colony grows for \eqn{\tau} weeks, then begins to
decline in week \eqn{\tau + 1}.}
\item{\code{logN0} is the intercept of the
growth function.  It reflects actual initial colony size, if the colony
initially grows exponentially.  It would also be lower if there were a few
weeks lag before growth started in the field.}
\item{\code{logLam} is the
average (log-scale) colony growth rate (i.e., rate of weight gain per unit
\code{t}) during the growth period.}
\item{\code{decay} reflects the rate of decline during the decline period.
Equivalent to ln(\eqn{\delta}) - ln(\eqn{\lambda}) (see vignette for more
in-depth explanation).}
\item{\code{logNmax} is the maximum weight reached by each colony.  It is a
function of \code{tau}, \code{logN0} and \code{logLam}}
\item{Additional columns are
coefficients for any covariates supplied in the \code{formula}}
}
When \code{augment = TRUE}, the original data are returned with these columns as
well as fitted values (\code{.fitted}) residuals (\code{.resid}) and standard error
(\code{.se.fit})
}
\description{
Fits generalized linear models that assume bumblebee colonies will switch
from growth to gyne production at some point, \eqn{\tau}. This allows for a
different switchpoint (\eqn{\tau}) for each colony, chosen by maximum
likelihood methods.
}
\details{
Colony growth is modeled as increasing exponentially until the
colony switches to gyne production, at which time the workers die and gynes
leave the colony, causing the colony to decline. The switch point,
\eqn{\tau}, may vary among colonies. This function works by modifying the
data and fitting genearlized linear models (GLMs). Because of this, the
assumptions for GLMs apply, namely independence and homogeneity of
variance. See \code{vignette("bumbl", package = "bumbl")} for more details on
the underlying math of the model.

# Colony 67 doesn't ever switch to reproduction and results in an error
\dontrun{
bumbl(bombus, colonyID = colony, t = week, formula = mass ~ week)
}

bombus2 <- bombus[bombus$colony != 67, ]
bumbl(bombus2, colonyID = colony, t = week, formula = mass ~ week)
