\usage{
bumbl(
  data,
  t,
  formula,
  family = gaussian(link = "log"),
  colonyID = NULL,
  augment = FALSE,
  keep.model = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe or tibble with a column for colony ID (as a
\code{character} or \code{factor}), a column for some measure of time (\code{numeric}),
and a column for some measure of colony growth (\code{numeric}), at minimum.}

\item{t}{the unquoted column name of the time variable.}

\item{formula}{a formula with the form \code{response ~ time + covariates} where
response is your measure of colony growth, time is whatever measure of time
you have (date, number of weeks, etc.) and covariates are any optional
co-variates you want to fit at the colony level.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function.
This is passed to \code{\link[=glm]{glm()}} except in the case of \code{family = "negbin"}, which
causes \code{\link[MASS:glm.nb]{MASS::glm.nb()}} to be used to fit a negative binomial GLM.}

\item{colonyID}{the unquoted column name of the colony ID variable. This is
required, so to run \code{bumbl()} on a single colony, you must create a dummy
column with a colony ID.}

\item{augment}{when FALSE, \code{bumbl} returns a summary dataframe with one row
for each colonyID.  When TRUE, it returns the original data with additional
columns containing model coefficients. Cannot be used in conjunction with
\code{keep.model = TRUE}.}

\item{keep.model}{If TRUE, then the output will contain a list-column with
the models for each colony. This may be useful for extracting statistics
and performing model diagnostics not provided by \code{bumbl()}. Learn more
about working with list columns with \code{vignette("nest", package = "tidyr")}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[=glm]{glm()}} or \code{\link[MASS:glm.nb]{MASS::glm.nb()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the additional class \code{bumbldf} containing a
summary of the data with a row for every colony and the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{converged} indicates whether the winning model converged.}
\item{\code{tau} is the switchpoint, in the same units as \code{t}, for
each \code{colonyID}.  The colony grows for \eqn{\tau} weeks, then begins to
decline in week \eqn{\tau + 1}.}
\item{\code{logN0} is the intercept of the
growth function.  It reflects actual initial colony size, if the colony
initially grows exponentially.  It would also be lower if there were a few
weeks lag before growth started in the field.}
\item{\code{logLam} is the
average (log-scale) colony growth rate (i.e., rate of weight gain per unit
\code{t}) during the growth period.}
\item{\code{decay} reflects the rate of decline during the decline period.
Equivalent to ln(\eqn{\delta}) - ln(\eqn{\lambda}) (see vignette for more
in-depth explanation).}
\item{\code{logNmax} is the maximum weight reached by each colony.  It is a
function of \code{tau}, \code{logN0} and \code{logLam}}
\item{Additional columns are
coefficients for any covariates supplied in the \code{formula}}
}
When \code{augment = TRUE}, the original data are returned with these columns as
well as fitted values (\code{.fitted}) residuals (\code{.resid}) and standard error
(\code{.se.fit}).  When \code{keep.model = TRUE} a list-column with the \code{glm} models
for each colony is returned as well.

\description{
Fits generalized linear models that assume bumblebee colonies will switch
from growth to gyne production at some point, \eqn{\tau}. This allows for a
different switchpoint (\eqn{\tau}) for each colony, chosen by maximum
likelihood methods.
}
\details{
Colony growth is modeled as increasing exponentially until the
colony switches from producing workers to producing reproductive
individuals (drones and gynes), at which time the workers die and gynes
leave the colony, causing the colony to decline. The switch point,
\eqn{\tau}, may vary among colonies. \code{bumbl()} finds the value of
\eqn{\tau} that maximizes likelihood and this "winning" model is used to
calculate statistics returned in the output. This function works by fitting
generalized linear models (GLMs) to modified colony growth data. Because of
this, the assumptions for GLMs apply, namely independence and homogeneity
of variance. See \code{vignette("bumbl", package = "bumbl")} for more details on
the underlying math of the model.
}
\note{
This function \emph{assumes} there is a switchpoint and does not test
whether the switchpoint model is significantly better than a log-linear
model. As a result, it may estimate a switchpoint even if the data do not
represent a true switchpoint. See the vignette for an example of how to
extract the GLMs---you could compare them to a simpler log-linear model
without the switchpoint by AIC or a likelihood ratio test to test the
significance of the switchpoint.
