#' *Bombus vosnesenskii* colony growth and estimated floral resrouces
#'
#' This is a subset of the data from Crone and Williams, 2016.  *Bombus vosnesenskii* colonies were placed in sites in a mixed agricultural--natural area in California, USA and weighed weekly.

#' @format A data frame with 178 rows and 10 columns
#' \describe{
#'   \item{site}{The site ID}
#'   \item{colony}{The colony ID}
#'   \item{wild}{The proportion of the habitat for that site classified as wild using GIS}
#'   \item{habitat}{The habitat type. Either wild (W), organic agriculture (O), or conventional agriculture (C)}
#'   \item{date}{The calendar date the measurements were taken on}
#'   \item{week}{Number of weeks since the initial mass was taken}
#'   \item{mass}{Colony mass, in grams}
#'   \item{floral_resources}{Floral density in millions of flowers within a 2km radius around the colony, weighted as a function of distance from colony}
#' }
#' @details Floral resources (*e*) are weighted using the equation *w* = *e*^(*-D/a*) where *D* is the distance in meters between the resources and the colony and *a* is the typical flight distance for the species. This is described in further detail in Williams et al. 2012.
