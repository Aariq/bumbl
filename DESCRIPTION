Description: Bumblebee colonies grow during worker production, then decline after switching to production of reproductive individuals (drones and gynes).  This package provides tools for modeling and visualizing this pattern by identifying a switchpoint with a growth rate before and a decline rate after the switchpoint. The mathematical models fit by bumbl are described in Crone and Williams (2016) <doi:10.1111/ele.12581>.
